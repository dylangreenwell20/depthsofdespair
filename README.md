# Depths of Despair README
COMP3016 C++ Console Application Game

To develop the game, I used the following versions of Visual Studio and Windows 10:
Visual Studio Version: Visual Studio Community 2022 - 17.7.6
Windows Version: Windows 10 Home - Version 22H2

How does the game play?
The game is a turn-based combat game where the player will control a character going through a dungeon in search of an ancient relic.
Throughout the dungeon floors, there are enemies that the player will have to defeat to move on. Each completed dungeon floor grants the player a stat increase.
Combat is automatic and the player can choose what stat upgrade they want and what action they want to carry out.
There are 2 endings to the game - a good ending and a bad ending, but the bad ending is more of a joke.
